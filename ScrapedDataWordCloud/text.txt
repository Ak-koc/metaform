The no-con system was also installed. The first 147G was delivered to the USAF in July 1965. By this time U-2 overflights of defended airspace had been phased out, with that mission left to the Lightning Bugs. The Model 147G performed its first mission in October 1965, and the Model 147B flew its last mission that December.\n', 'High-altitude reconnaissance over North Vietnam proved somewhat impractical. During the ', ' season, from November through March, the skies were mostly overcast, and even in fair weather smoke or ground haze could obscure reconnaissance targets. For this reason, the Air Force decided to develop a low-altitude version of the Lightning Bug. In October 1965, the service issued a contract to Ryan to develop the ', ', a fast-track modification of the Model 147G with a low-altitude navigation system. Low-altitude flight was more demanding than high-altitude flight, since there were many more things to run into, and a number of Model 147J drones were lost in development.\n', 'Among the 77 missions flown by the drones in 1965 were three flights by a special SIGINT modification of the Model 147B, designated the ', ', another ""SAM sniffer"" variant. Three Model 147Es were sent to South Vietnam in October 1965 as part of a program codenamed UNITED EFFORT. The SIGINT packages failed on all three initial missions, and the Model 147Es were sent back to the U.S. for environmental tests to track down the problem; it turned out that the SIGINT package failed when overheated. The problem was corrected and the Model 147Es were sent back to the combat zone.\n', 'On 13 February 1966 — the fourth Model 147E mission — the drone was destroyed by an SA-2, but not before it relayed the vital signal data. The U.S. had been desperate to get this data ever since the deployment of the SA-2, and officials claimed that this single flight justified the entire Model 147 program. The information was immediately put to use to develop a simple warning system that would tell the pilot when an SA-2 command signal was turned on, meaning a missile launch was imminent; this device would go into production as the AN/APR-26.\n', 'Another box, the AN/ALQ-51 ""Shoe Horn"", had been developed to help deal with the Fan Song radar. The AN/ALQ-51 was a ""deception jammer"", meaning it manipulated the radar signals to mislead the radar into thinking the target was somewhere other than its actual location. Since the Americans hadn\'t actually got their hands on a Fan Song at the time, the box had been tested in the U.S. against a radar simulating a Fan Song. The jammer worked well in tests, but fielding it without sending it up against a real Fan Song was out of the question. The Model 147 was then used to operationally test the box. A single Model 147B was fitted with the package and redesignated ', ', flying a number of missions in July 1966. It was finally lost after almost a dozen SA-2s had been fired at it.\n', 'A primary virtue of the Lightning Bugs was that they were far more expendable than piloted reconnaissance aircraft; but by early 1966 an average of four out of five Lightning Bugs failed to return from missions. This loss rate was unacceptable even for a relatively cheap drone, and the Air Force asked Ryan to quickly convert ten standard Firebee target drones to expendable ', '. They were fitted with ', ' (TWT) active radar enhancement devices to make them look like a bigger aircraft on radar. There were no provisions for recovery or long-range fuel capacity, since their missions were to be one-way only.\n', 'The decoys were designated ', ', with the first mission performed by one alongside a Model 147G on March 3, 1966. The two drones followed a parallel path until they reached the target area, where they diverged. North Vietnamese air defenses tracked the ""brighter"" 147N instead of the 147G, which was recovered. As an added bonus the 147Ns resulted in a few ""kills"" of North Vietnamese fighter aircraft. One fighter ran out of fuel when the pilot chased the drone out to sea, and other fighters were lost due to ""friendly fire"" accidents while hunting the drones.\n', 'The decoys worked so well that the Air Force ordered another batch of ten with a few minor improvements, and designated them ', '. The initial Model 147Ns had been programmed to turn back and head for home in order to simulate a normal operational drone flight profile, and a few of them surprisingly did make it back even with their limited fuel supply. They crashed since they were not designed to be recovered, but the recovery system was not expensive and so the Model 147NX was fitted with recovery parachutes and gear as well as a cheap camera. If the decoy survived the mission, it might provide useful intelligence.\n', 'By March 1966 the low-altitude Model 147J was ready for operational service; it featured a ""barometric altitude control system"" (BLACS), a dual camera payload featuring a front-to-back scan camera, a side-to-side scan camera and a new paint job. The high-altitude Lightning Bugs had been painted black which is a high-visibility color at low altitude. Model 147Js were painted gray on top and white underneath.\n', 'The fast-moving 147J drones streaked low over the ground, making them difficult targets and increasing their odds of returning from a mission. Up to that time the drones had parachuted to the ground when they returned, but were often damaged by the impact; the USAF then came up with a retrieval method using a big Sikorsky ', ' helicopter that ', ' and ', ' it in.

One of the 147Js actually took a picture of an SA-2 ', ' streaking past it.\n', 'The Air Force was very pleased with the low-altitude Model 147J and feared there would not be enough of them to keep up with operational attrition. Some Model 147Gs were modified to the 147J configuration, but the USAF also asked Ryan to come up with a new low-altitude reconnaissance drone on a fast track. The new variant was the ', ', which was derived from the initial Model 147A.

In particular, if the exhaust is deflected downward as it leaves the propulsor, a circulation control effect is realized. Even at low angle of attack, high lift coefficients have been shown with CFD and validated with wind tunnel experiments.', '\n', 'The Propulsive Wing controls pitch and roll controls through vectored thrust.

The NV-105A was accepted by the Navy and went into production as the MQM-74A in 1968.\n"", 'The MQM-74A had a neatly tapered cigar-shaped fuselage, straight mid-mounted wings, an underslung jet engine with the intake under the wings, and a conventional tail configuration with the tailplanes set in an inverted vee. It was powered by a ', ' WR24-6 turbojet engine with a thrust of 121 pounds (538 N), and was launched by RATO booster from the ground or a ship. The Navy purchased 1,800 MQM-74A Chukar Is. Several hundred more were purchased in total by ', ' for a multinational test range on the island of ', ', as well as the ', ' and the ', '.\n', ' is the name of an Asian species of ', ', introduced to America and as they are hunted for sport, it seems that Northrop felt that the name was appropriate for an aircraft whose purpose in life is to be shot at. The name Chukar is only formally applied to export versions of the drone, but informally it is used for all variants.\n', 'In the mid-1970s, the US ', ' used the MQM-74A as the basis for an experimental drone designated the XBQM-108, which was to be used to as a demonstrator for a ""pogo"" or ""tailsitter"" aircraft that could take off and land straight up and down on its tail. The ', ', ', ', ', ' system, and parachute recovery system of the MQM-74A were retained, but the drone was fitted with a new wing, a Teledyne CAE J402 engine with a rotating ', ' exhaust, fixed ', ', and additional flight control systems. The demonstrator was completed and was making tethered flights when the program was canceled.\n', 'The Navy liked the Chukar I but wanted a somewhat faster version, and in the early 1970s Northrop developed the improved experimental MQM-74B, which was followed by the production MQM-74C Chukar II. The Chukar II is difficult to distinguish from the Chukar I, but the Chukar II is slightly scaled up and uses an uprated Williams WR24-7 turbojet with 180 pound (800 N) thrust, giving it a top speed of 590\xa0mph (950\xa0km/h).\n', 'Like the Chukar I, the Chukar II is ground or ship launched only. At least 1,400 Chukar IIs were built, mostly for the US Navy, but other customers included NATO, the United Kingdom, ', ', Greece, ', ', Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, ', ', and Spain.\n', 'In 1978, the US Navy requested a still more sophisticated drone, and Northrop responded with the BQM-74C Chukar III. This improved variant is visibly different from its predecessors, featuring a more cylindrical fuselage, in contrast with the tapered fuselage of its predecessors.\n', 'The BQM-74C incorporates a ', '-based ', ' that allows it to be programmed for much more sophisticated flight operations. The BQM-74C can be air launched as well as ground launched. The original engine was the Williams WR24-7A AKA J400-WR-402, with 180 pound (800 N) thrust, but in 1986 production was upgraded to the J400-WR-403 with 240 pound (1070 N) thrust. The BQM-74C is stressed for maneuvers of up to 6Gs. More than 1,600 BQM-74Cs have been built.\n', 'Northrop built ten BQM-74C Recce UAVs for tactical ', ' for US Navy evaluation, but this variant did not go into production.\n', 'The BQM-74C has now been replaced in production by the BQM-74E, which is externally all but identical but incorporates the uprated J400-WR-404 engine as standard, and has a third greater range and endurance than its predecessor.\n', 'On 6 January 2015 PHT, Filipino fishermen recovered a drone of this kind floating off in the waters near Patnanungan, Quezon Province, Philippines. \n', "" The US Embassy in Manila said that the drone was actually fired four months earlier during American naval exercises off Guam and was just washed ashore in the Philippines through ocean currents. The country's Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Raul Hernandez appeared to support the US Embassy explanation, adding that at no time was the aerial target drone launched nor did it fly or crash within the Philippine territory. Human rights groups and even left-wing inclined groups/organizations have either condemned, criticized or called for an investigation regarding the incident, saying that drones can be used for surveillance and they can be used for actual combat operations, as well as suggesting it is used on spying on activities of the communist New People's Army as part of counterinsurgency efforts. However, Maj. Harold Cabunoc, spokesperson of the Philippine Army, denied  that drones were taking part in the fight against rebels."", '\n', 'In the 1980s, Northrop built a next-generation target, the NV-144, that was substantially bigger and faster than the Chukar III, but the NV-144 did not enter production. The latest and current effort by Northrop Grumman to improve the Chukar is the BQM-74F variant of the Chukar (previously called the Target 2000). The BQM-74F has general configuration along the lines of the BQM-74C, but features swept wings, an empty weight of 600 pounds (270 kilograms), an uprated engine with 300 pound (1.33\xa0kN) thrust, speed of up to Mach 0.93, and a design lifetime of 20 flights. The BQM-74F will be able to simulate a range of different aircraft and cruise missiles. It will also be able to tow targets and decoys, and will be compatible with current Chukar support systems and infrastructure. The Navy awarded Northrop Grumman a development contract in 2002, and the first BQM-74F was unveiled on August 22, 2005, with its first flight taking place seven days later at the naval air station in Point Mugu, California.', '\n', 'In the 1991 ', ', BQM-74Cs were used as decoys during the initial air attacks into Iraq. The USAF ', ' group was put in charge of the decoy effort, which was codenamed ""Project Scathe Mean"".', '\n', 'The Chukar drones that were available were usually launched from ', ' director aircraft, and could also be launched from strike aircraft such as F-15s or F-16s. These launch resources were not available though, so the Navy found twelve ground launchers in their inventory that could be made serviceable, while ', ' booster units were found stockpiled in Belgium. Each BQM-74C was fitted with a pair of ', ' to enhance its radar signature to imitate a manned aircraft.\n', 'A 40-person team of specialists, obtained from disbanded ground-launched cruise missile units (see ', '), was assembled in a few days and designated the ""4468th Tactical Reconnaissance Group"". The 4468th TRG moved quickly, with trucks modified and obtained from a California commercial trucking firm, tool kits purchased from ', ', and field gear bought from war surplus stores. The teams were given quick training, equipped with 44 Navy BQM-74Cs, and sent to ', ' in two six-launcher teams in about two weeks, arriving near the Iraqi border on 15 October 1990. The northern team was sited to cover Baghdad and large military bases in that area, while the southern team was sited to cover ', ' and ', '.\n', 'When the ', ' began on the night of 17 January 1991, Iraq was hit by attack waves of ', ' stealth fighters and ', ' cruise missiles. A group of 38 BQM-74Cs were assigned to be launched as diversion for the second wave of attacks, with the launches generally in groups of three, and 37 were launched successfully in precisely timed waves. One group of three was intercepted by Iraqi aircraft, while all the others made it to target.\n', 'The drones flew over 500 kilometers (310 miles) at 630\xa0km/h (390\xa0mph), then began to circle ', ' for up to 20 minutes. Iraqi air defense radars which probed for the drones were engaged by allied strike aircraft firing ', ' (High-speed Anti-Radiation Missiles). The Navy also launched ', ' (Tactical Air Launched Decoys)  to contribute to the countermeasures blitz. Iraqi air defenses never recovered from this blow, and though large Allied aircraft losses had been predicted, the Iraqis only succeeded in shooting down 44 manned aircraft. After the war, the 4468th was disbanded, and one of the remaining BQM-74Cs was donated to the ', ' at ', ' in Ohio, where it is now on display.\n', 'On 16 November 2013, a BQM-74E hit and damaged the ', ', slightly injuring two sailors and making a hole in the superstructure just above the deck. The drone was supposed to turn away more than a mile from the cruiser during exercises to test the latest version of the ', ', but instead continued straight into the ship.', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ' – \n', ' –\n', ' –\n', ' –\n', ' – \n', ' – \n', '\n']"

In 1975 the Army put the follow-on effort up for bid, and Lockheed was the low bidder. This phase of the program lasted until 1979 and demonstrated that the system had military potential and it could be developed at a reasonable risk. The RPV-STD effort created a non-stealthy tailless air vehicle with anhedral wing tips, that was launched by a pneumatic launcher, and was recovered in a trampoline-like structure which held a net. The system used an unsecured data link for tracking and data. From December 1975-November 1977 this RPV-STD system flew 149 flights, 35 by the contractor, and 114 by the Army team. At the completion of this phase the Aviation Systems Command worked with the user proponent which was the Artillery Branch to develop the requirements for a field-able system.\n', ""In 1979 the Aviation Systems Command issued a Full Scale Engineering Development Request for Proposal for a systems which would meet the Artillery's Required Operational Capability. Lockheed Missile and Space Division won the contract in late 1979. The contract provided for the delivery off 22 air vehicles, 4 Ground Control Stations, 3 Launch Systems, 3 Recovery Systems and support hardware. This target acquisition, designation and aerial reconnaissance (TADAR) program effort produced a stealthy tailless aircraft driven by a Herbrandson piston engine with a 26-inch (660\xa0mm) pusher propeller. The Westinghouse payload was a television imager/laser designator in a turret in the belly. The laser designator was intended for use with the "", ' artillery ammunition and the ', ' missile. Development of a Ford Aerospace FLIR/laser designator payload began in 1984. Secure communications with the air vehicle was provided by a joint Army/Air Force program called Modular Integrated Communications/Navigational System (MICNS). On the nose of the air vehicle was a Near IR source which interacted with the Recovery System to automatically recover the aircraft after the flight.\n', 'The Aquila was hydraulically launched by an All American Engineering catapult mounted on a 5-ton truck. The hydraulically operated Recovery System, built by ', ', consisted of a vertical net held by a frame work shaped like an inverted ""h"" into which the air vehicle would automatically fly. This was also mounted on a 5-ton truck. For testing and training an emergency parachute backup recovery system was provided. The necessity for these systems was the specified requirement to be able to enter a small clearing surrounded by 50-foot (15\xa0m) trees and to be able to quickly launch a mission. Then at the end of a mission, land in a similar clearing surrounded with 50-foot (15\xa0m) trees and quickly relocate the system after recovery.\n', 'The Ground Control System(GCS) was also mounted on the back of a 5-ton truck and provided room for three operators to control the mission.  The air vehicle operator controlled the flight by entering in way-points and orbit parameters into the Norden computer. The payload operator used a joystick and console to control the pointing of the payload camera, the auto-tracking of the target, and the laser designating.  The third operator was the mission commander which controlled the overall mission and maintained communications with his commander. The GCS was connected to the Remote Ground Terminal air vehicle tracking/communications antenna over a fiber optic cable.\n', 'Due to a delay in the MICNS secure data link, the first prototype system was produced in a Block I configuration. This system used the same air vehicle (minus the MICNS and automated landing system), the same hydraulic launcher, the same hydraulically operated recovery system, and same Ground Control System. This system used an unsecure interim data link and an alternate semi-automatic system to guide the air vehicle into the net. This system flew 17 flights during July–November 1982. This system was then assigned to an Army Early Operational Capability (EOC) unit from July 1983-July 1984 which conducted 20 flights. This EOC effort was created to provide the field with a system to identify any system weakness and provide the user to refine his tactics, techniques, and procedures for using the technology.\n', ""The complete MQM-105 began its contractor flight testing in December 1983 in Fort Huachuca, AZ. The Phase I of Government Developmental Testing II(DT II) began in  May 1985 but testing was suspended in Sept 1985 because the system did not pass 21 of the 149 performance specifications. From October 1985-January 1986, Lockheed conducted a Test-Fix-Test effort at its own expense, and demonstrated that the major problems were solved. The DT IIA began in February 1986 and successfully completed in May 1986 although reliability problems continued to dog the system. The Government's Operational Test ran from October 1986 through March 1987. Although the Army requested that the system be put in production, the DOD review board cancelled the program in 1987. Aviation Week and Space Technology Magazine showed residual assets being used in US Army/South Korea war games in 1988.\n"", 'The original fielding plans called for 780 air vehicles and 72 Launcher/Recovery System/Ground Control Station combinations.\n', 'There was turmoil throughout most of the Engineering Development of the Aquila Program both from internal and external causes. Within a year of the 1979 contract award, Congress zeroed the funding for the program as part of an overall budget reduction effort. Funding was restored in the following budget. Although the Aviation Systems Command was tasked with  managing the system development, the Army Aviation Branch was generally hostile to the RPV in the fear that it would reduce the need for pilots and it competed for funds with the AHIP OH-58D program.  Although the program was developed for the Artillery Branch, if the system had been fielded, it would have fallen under the Intelligence Branch. Lockheed moved the development effort from California ', "" which broke up the contractor's development team. The Army moved the program management responsibilities from St. Louis, Mo. to Huntsville, AL in 1985 which broke up that team. To save program costs, the operational approach was modified from self-contained units to centralized launch and recovery with in-flight hand-offs between ground stations.\n"", 'The Aquila, as with other small RPVs, always labored under the ""It\'s just a model airplane, why does it cost so much?"" syndrome. This led to a relatively low-cost airframe, with many single point failure points, carrying expensive payloads and data links.', '\n', 'When the ', "" demonstrated the real world usefulness of RPV's in the "", "" in 1982, U. S. support for the systems jumped. The Army began to push for new variants of Aquila such as Aquila Lite which attempted to redesign the ground systems to be carried on HMMWV's instead of 5 ton trucks. In addition, U.S Naval and Air Force interest in having RPV/UAV systems blossomed. Multiple Navy and Air Force systems were proposed. To attempt to prevent duplicate efforts, Congress proposed that the Air Force be responsible for air vehicle development and the Navy develop the payloads. Since the Aquila was so far along in its development it was allowed to continue outside of the proposed framework (somewhat as an orphan). All three services balked at Congress's proposal.\n"", 'Lockheed also considered a variant of the Aquila named the ""Altair"" for international sales, but without the government production tooling the program was unaffordable.\n', '\n', '\n', '\n\n\n\n\n']"

These all could be installed in an airplane which could be catapulted or flown from the water, and would climb to a predetermined altitude, fly a pre-set course, and after traveling a pre-set distance, drop its bombs or dive to the ground.

No flight or wind-tunnel testing of the design was performed before production began. The first was delivered on November 10.\n', 'One of the most daunting challenges to the designers was the launch mechanism. The original concept envisioned by Hewitt and Sperry was a catapult mechanism or from the water (the N-9s were seaplanes, the Flying Bomb was not). For the Flying Bomb, it was decided to try to launch it by sliding it down a long wire. In November and December 1917, three attempts were made to launch the Flying Bomb. On the first launch, one wing was damaged as the plane went down the wire, and on the second, the plane lifted from the wire but immediately plunged to the ground. The wire method was then abandoned in favor of a traditional catapult with a 150-foot (46\xa0m) track, with power obtained from a 3-ton weight being dropped from a height of 30 feet (9.1\xa0m). On the third try, the plane lagged behind the cart, damaging the propeller, and the plane flipped over its nose. Two more attempts in January, 1918, saw the plane get airborne, but it was too tail-heavy, so it stalled and crashed almost immediately.\n', ""It was realized that some flight test evaluation of the aircraft's capabilities was necessary.

While taxiing it on ice, he hit some slushy snow, and wrecked the plane, though Sperry was unhurt. A second airplane was fitted out, and Sperry managed to get it in the air, but lost control when the automatic pilot was engaged.

The design of the fuselage was changed slightly, lengthening it by two feet.\n', 'The Marmon was not only an excellent way to adjust the flight controls, it was realized that it would also be a good launching platform, and this was tried on March 6, 1918. The aircraft left the car cleanly, and flew in stable flight for the 1,000 yards (910\xa0m) that the distance-measuring gear had been set for. For the first time in history, an unmanned, heavier-than-air vehicle had flown in controlled flight.\n', 'The feat, however, could not be duplicated, and it was thought that the roadway was too rough. The Marmon was fitted with railroad wheels, and an unused spur of the ', ', four miles (6\xa0km) east of ', ' was put back into service. On the first try, before full flying speed had been reached, the aircraft developed enough lift to raise the front wheels off the track, and another crash resulted. It was time to re-think the catapult system, and to help design it, Sperry and Hewitt hired a young and promising engineer named ', '. The first try with the new system was in August, 1918, and it too resulted in a crash. Two more tests were tried, with the stabilization package that had been design for the Flying Bomb replaced with the four-gyro system used earlier on the N-9 tests, but the result was again a disappointment, with very short flights ending in crashes. On the last one, on September 26, the Flying Bomb climbed straight for about a hundred yards, then entered a spiral dive and crashed. This was the final flight for the Curtiss-Sperry Flying Bomb, as all the usable airframes had been consumed in crashes, and there remained no confidence in the design. Sperry and Hewitt returned to the N-9.\n', 'The Sperrys built a wind tunnel at the ', ' and carried out a series of tests on the N-9, fine tuning the design. On October 17, an unmanned N-9 was launched using the new Norden catapult system. It came cleanly off the track, climbed steadily and flew within 2° of the line of intended flight. The distance gear had been set for a flight of eight miles (13\xa0km), but somehow malfunctioned. When last seen, the N-9 was cruising over Bayshore Air Station at about 4,000 feet (1,200\xa0m), heading east. It was ', '.', '\n', 'Despite the success of the stabilization gear, there was doubt in the Navy about the program, and they asked ', ' to review the Sperry components and recommend improvement. The navy was, by now, satisfied with the concept, and was contemplating purchasing such equipment on its own, apart from the Sperrys. Elmer Sperry tried to stir up enthusiasm again, calling the concept of the flying bomb the ""gun of the future"". This was to no avail, however. World War I came to a close when the ', ' was signed on November 11, 1918. Almost a hundred flights had been flown in the N-9, but  almost all of these were in the N-9s and had a ', ' on board. The Navy took complete control of the program from Sperry, spelling the end of the Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane.\n', 'During the early post-war years, the Navy sponsored similar projects. For the first program, Witteman-Lewis aircraft and Norden-designed gyrostabilizers were used, but the results were no better than those achieved by the Sperrys. In 1921, the program was reoriented to focus on the radio control aspect. The control equipment was developed at the radio laboratory at NAS Anacostia (later the ', '). In 1923, tests began, and were relatively successful, but interest waned and the project lapsed in 1925.

Since two different types of drag dominate in each of these two flight regimes, uniting high performance designs for each regime into a single airframe is problematic.\n', 'At low Mach numbers ', ' dominates drag concerns. Airplanes during takeoff and gliders are most concerned with induced drag. One way to reduce induced drag is to increase the effective wingspan of the lifting surface. This is why ', ' have such long, narrow wings. An ideal wing has infinite span and induced drag is reduced to a two–dimensional property. At lower speeds, during takeoffs and landings, an oblique wing would be positioned perpendicular to the fuselage like a conventional wing to provide maximum lift and control qualities. As the aircraft gained speed, the wing would be pivoted to increase the oblique angle, thereby reducing the drag due to wetted area, and decreasing fuel consumption.\n', 'Alternatively, at Mach numbers increasing towards the speed of sound and beyond, ', ' dominates design concerns. As the aircraft displaces the air, a sonic wave is generated. Sweeping the wings away from the nose of the aircraft can keep the wings aft of the sonic wave, greatly reducing drag. Unfortunately, for a given wing design, increasing sweep decreases the ', '. At high speeds, both subsonic and ', "", an oblique wing would be pivoted at up to 60 degrees to the aircraft's fuselage for better high-speed performance. The studies showed these angles would decrease aerodynamic drag, permitting increased speed and longer range with the same fuel expenditure.\n"", 'Fundamentally, it appears that no design can be completely optimized for both flight regimes. However, the oblique wing shows promise of getting close. By actively increasing sweep as Mach number increases, high efficiency is possible for a wide range of speeds.\n', 'It is theorized', ' that an oblique flying wing could drastically improve commercial air transportation, reducing fuel costs and noise in the vicinity of airports.

This limits modern helicopters to cruise speeds of about 150 ', ' / 277\xa0km/h. However, with the tiltrotor this problem is avoided, because the proprotors are perpendicular to the motion in the high-speed portions of the flight regime (and thus not subject to this reverse flow condition), so the tiltrotor has relatively high maximum speed—over 300\xa0knots / 560\xa0km/h has been demonstrated in the two types of tiltrotors flown so far, and cruise speeds of 250\xa0knots / 460\xa0km/h  are achieved.', '\n', 'This speed is achieved somewhat at the expense of ', '. As a result of this reduced payload, some', ' estimate that a tiltrotor does not exceed the transport efficiency (speed times payload) of a helicopter,', ' while others conclude the opposite.', ' Additionally, the tiltrotor propulsion system is more complex than a conventional helicopter due to the large, articulated nacelles and the added wing; however, the improved cruise efficiency and speed improvement over helicopters is significant in certain uses.  Speed and, more importantly, the benefit to overall response time is the principal virtue sought by the military forces that are using the tiltrotor. Tiltrotors are inherently less noisy in forward flight (airplane mode) than helicopters.', ' This, combined with their increased speed, is expected to improve their utility in populated areas for commercial uses and reduce the threat of detection for military uses. Tiltrotors, however, are typically as loud as equally sized helicopters in hovering flight. Noise simulations for a 90-passenger tiltrotor indicate lower cruise noise inside the cabin than a ', ' airplane, although low-frequency vibrations may be higher.', '\n', 'Tiltrotors also provide substantially greater cruise altitude capability than helicopters. Tiltrotors can easily reach 6,000\xa0m / 20,000\xa0ft or more whereas helicopters typically do not exceed 3,000\xa0m / 10,000\xa0ft altitude.  This feature will mean that some uses that have been commonly considered only for fixed-wing aircraft can now be supported with tiltrotors without need of a runway. A drawback however is that a tiltrotor suffers considerably reduced payload when taking off from high altitude.\n', 'A mono tiltrotor aircraft uses a tiltable rotating ', ', or ', ', for ', ' and ', '. For vertical flight the proprotor is angled to direct its thrust downwards, providing lift. In this mode of operation the craft is essentially identical to a helicopter.

In this mode the wing provides the lift, and the wing's greater efficiency helps the tiltrotor achieve its high speed.

In AATI demonstrations, a Dragon Drone is attached to a piggyback frame that harnesses the drone to the parasail.

The drone is then released, diving until it builds up enough speed for the operator to pull it out of the dive and sent it on its mission.\n', 'In recovery, the parasail is used to lift a tow line into the sky, with the tow line trailing a series of recovery lines hanging between the parasail and the ship. The drone is flown into the recovery lines, and a snaplock mechanism on the drone\'s wing grabs onto a line. The drone is then reeled back down to the ship. The tow line has more ""give"" to it than a recovery net, reducing the likelihood of damage.\n', 'The current RITS scheme can handle UAVs weighing up to 180 kilograms (400 pounds), but AATI thinks it can be scaled up to handle larger aircraft. AATI claims the system is inexpensive and easy to use. They also point out that the parasail could also be used to loft an antenna to allow over-the-horizon communications with a UAV.

The Switchblade is small enough to be carried in a ', ' and can be launched from a variety of ground, maritime, and air platforms.\n', 'The Switchblade was originally conceived by ', ' (AFSOC) before being picked up by the Army.', ' It was first unveiled in August 2011 to fill a gap U.S. troops were facing in Afghanistan.  If insurgents ambushed a patrol, options available to push back the attacks were limited.  ', ' takes time to arrive, is expensive to conduct, and risks collateral damage if in urban areas.  If the troops are out of range of artillery support, guided missiles like the ', ' are available, but also very expensive.  Another problem was that small man-portable UAVs like the Raven or Puma that can spot threats have no way of quickly engaging them because available weapons are too heavy for them to carry.  The Switchblade combines the man-portability, low-cost, and recon ability of small UAVs with an explosive warhead to quickly locate and destroy enemy fighters, especially in dug-in positions like rooftops or ridge lines.  On 29 July 2011, the U.S. Army awarded AeroVironment a $4.9 million contract for ""rapid fielding"" an unspecified number of Switchblades to forces in Afghanistan.', ' On 20 March 2012, the Army awarded a contract modification to the company of $5.1 million, totaling a $10 million order for Switchblade UAVs.', '\n', 'In May 2012, the ', ' began the process of ordering the Switchblade loitering munition to enable an organic ability to engage targets like ', "" (IED) emplacement teams.  Usually when air support is called in, attackers slip away before a large UAV, attack helicopter, fighter-bomber, or quick reaction force can arrive on station.

Shortly after, a joint urgent needs statement was requested by the Army theater commanders for more systems.  The number requested was not specified, but was ""dramatically more"" than the 75 systems initially supplied and exceeded budget limitations.  The Switchblade gained notoriety among soldiers using it and insurgents being targeted by it.  The Army classifies it as a direct fire munition rather than a drone.', ' Soldiers embraced it as a valuable tool, especially to reduce collateral damage.  Unlike most other weapons, the Switchblade can wave off or abort a mission if the situation changes after launch, allowing it to engage a secondary target or destroy itself without inflicting casualties or property damage;', ' the wave off capability was used over a dozen times to prevent civilian casualties that could have been caused had a man not been in the loop.', '\n', 'On 28 August 2013, AeroVironment announced it had been awarded five contracts totaling $15.8 million to supply more Switchblade systems, ancillary equipment, and support to the Army.', ' One week later, ', ' gave the company a follow-on contract worth $6.6 million.

It is 2\xa0ft (610\xa0mm) long and weighs 6\xa0lb (2.7\xa0kg) including the carrying case and launcher, making it small and light enough for one soldier to carry.  The Switchblade is folded up inside a tube with wings unfolding once it gets airborne.  It can be controlled up to 10\xa0km (6.2\xa0mi) but its small size limits its endurance to 10 minutes.  This makes it unsuited for scouting roles, but it is useful for inexpensively engaging long-range targets and assisting in relieving units pinned down by enemy fire.

Its warhead has an explosive charge equivalent to a ', ' to destroy light armored vehicles and personnel.  If a situation causes a strike to be called off, the operator can call off the Switchblade and re-target it.  The aircraft is propelled by an electric engine, so its small size and silent flight makes it extremely difficult to detect or try to intercept, enabling it to close in on a target at 85 knots (98\xa0mph; 157\xa0km/h).  The Switchblade uses the same Ground Control Station (GCS) as other AeroVironment UAVs including the ', ', ', ', and ', '.  This creates commonality and the potential for teaming of longer-endurance small UAVs to recon for targets, then having the Switchblade attack once they are identified with the same controller.', '\n', ' regulations categorize the Switchblade as a ', ' rather than a drone, and the term ""', '"" is preferred to describe it; unlike UAVs, it is not recoverable once launched.

The Switchblade uses daytime and "", ', as well as an ""aided target tracker"" to lock on to stationary and moving targets.  The warhead is specifically designed for controlled firepower to reduce collateral damage through a focused blast, having a forward-firing ', '-blast effect rather than a 360-degree blast, throwing pellets on the same vector that the missile itself is traveling; it can also be fused to detonate at a predetermined height, which can be adjusted in-flight.  When diving, the air vehicle gives the operator the opportunity to wave off until four seconds from impact, and the warhead can be detonated in-flight to destroy it.  Being unique in its abilities, the Switchblade does not fit into several established doctrines, not being an armed reconnaissance vehicle dispatched by a platoon commander to scout over an area and destroy enemies, or an ', ' (ISR) platform, as its cameras are for seeing targets instead of performing recon.  There is also the question of whether small squads and platoons who lack high-level intelligence and communications should have the ability to fire missiles beyond ranges they are trying to influence.', '\n', 'Aside from being used against ground targets, ', ' has written software to combine the Switchblade with sensors to be able to intercept hostile UAVs.  The Switchblade is used alongside an existing counter-artillery radar and IED jamming system, all of which can be towed by ', '.  Interception of an enemy drone occurs in layers of defenses: if a drone gets through covering jet fighters or is too small to be targeted by them, it is picked up by the fire-finding radar; once detected, the jammer performs ', ' to break its ', '; if the drone resists EW, the Switchblade is launched to physically impact and destroy it.', '\n', 'On 28 April 2016, AeroVironment announced they had developed an upgrade for the Switchblade Tactical Missile system designated Block 10C.

This needs to be done with care to prevent being struck by the propeller, which would result in serious injury. Being a tail-dragging biplane, taxiing also requires care. The pilot cannot see directly ahead, so the lower wing can hit obstructions, and it is susceptible to gusts of wind on its inclined, large, upper wing.', '\n', 'The takeoff is uneventful, and it has a reasonable rate of climb. However full power should not be maintained for more than a minute to avoid damaging the engine.', '\n', ""The Tiger Moth's biplane design makes it strong, and it is fully aerobatic. However it has ailerons only on its bottom wing, which makes its rate of roll relatively slow for a biplane; and, as stated previously, the ailerons on a Tiger Moth normally operate with a heavy degree of designed-in differential operation (mostly deflecting up, hardly at all downwards) to avoid "", ' problems in normal flight.

The ramjet engine was thirsty, resulting in such short endurance that if a fighter pilot missed the drone on his first pass, it would have run out of fuel before he could come around again. To address these problems, Lavochkin engineers came up with a ground-launched variant, the La-17M, which performed its initial flights in 1959 and went into service in 1960.

Such a hybrid craft is still heavier than air, which makes it similar in some ways to a conventional aircraft.

This perception of uncommon dynamic flight range when coupled with an appropriate landing system is claimed to allow ultra heavy and affordable airlift transportation.', '\n', 'Compared to a conventional airship, the hybrid can be made smaller and does not need to carry ballast for altitude control, while compared to a heavier-than-air craft the hybrid requires either a smaller rotor or a shorter runway.', '\n', 'Where the dynastat is seen as more promising in the longer-distance passenger and freight roles, the rotastat is anticipated to be more suitable as a ""', '"" able to lift heavy external loads for shorter distances.', '\n', 'Some airships employ ', ', typically using pivoted ', ' propulsors, to provide additional lift when the engine thrust is no longer needed for forward propulsion. Once airspeed is gained, the craft can use body lift to help carry a load greater than its aerostatic lift capacity alone.', ' However, such airships are not usually regarded as hybrids.\n', 'The dynastat obtains additional lift by flying through the air.  Configurations studied have included using deltoid (triangular), lenticular (circular), or flattened hulls, or adding a fixed wing.\n', 'Some early airships were fitted with wing planes, with the intention of providing additional dynamic lift.', '  However, the added lift of planes can be less efficient than simply increasing the volume of the airship.  At low air speeds, of 60\xa0mph (97\xa0km/h) or less, the increase in lift obtained by the use of planes on an airship would require a disproportionate increase in engine power and fuel consumption compared to increasing the size of the gas bags.', ""  Moreover, the attachment of flying surfaces to the airship's envelope would require significant structural strengthening, with attendant weight gain."", '\n', 'Conventional airships often make use of aerodynamic lift by using their ', ' to set a nose-up attitude so that the main body of the airship provides some lift as it flies along; however, this is typically done to counteract minor out-of-trim conditions, and it is as likely that the nose may need to be pointed down to reduce lift.\n', 'Some Hybrid designs, such as the ', ', use a flattened or multi-lobed hull to increase the aerodynamic lift obtainable.  The aerodynamic approach is similar to that of a ', ' aircraft, although the airspeeds involved are much lower.  Attainable dynamic-lift-to-drag ratios are significantly below those of efficient fixed wings, in part because ', ' increases with decreasing aspect ratio.', '  As a result, the lift comes at a higher drag penalty than when using wings.  On the other hand, compared to a helicopter, the dynastat has better fuel efficiency within a given speed range.', '\n', 'Another issue arises during take off and landing, when, in calmer conditions, the airspeed may be too low to provide sufficient aerodynamic lift.', '  For this reason, the dynastat is often conceived of as a ', ' rather than ', ' aircraft, requiring a shorter runway than a conventional airplane.', '\n', 'The rotastat obtains additional lift from powered rotors, similarly to a helicopter.  Single-, twin-, and four-rotor designs have all been studied.\n', 'Early examples in the inter-war period included designs by ', ' and ', '.

Typically, aerostatic lift is sufficient to support the weight of the craft itself, while, when a load is carried, the rotors provide additional lift as required.\n', 'If an airship does not have enough lift, it will sink under gravity.  By angling the nose down, this can lead to a gliding forward flight just like a conventional ', '.  If an airship has excess lift, it will rise.  By angling the nose up, this can also lead to forward movement.  In this way, an airship which periodically alternates its buoyancy between positive and negative, while adjusting its attitude accordingly, can gain almost continuous aerodynamic forward thrust.  Thus, flight proceeds in a leisurely vertical zig-zag pattern.  Because no energy is consumed directly in creating thrust, the principle allows for flights of long duration, although at slow speeds.

It does however consume power at the points where it changes its buoyancy between positive and negative values.

Overall, only about 25% of the V-1s hit their targets, the majority being lost because of a combination of defensive measures, mechanical unreliability or guidance errors. With the capture or destruction of the launch facilities used to attack England, the V-1s were employed in attacks against strategic points in Belgium, primarily the port of ', '.', '\n', 'Launches against Britain were met by a variety of countermeasures, including ', ' and aircraft such as the ', ' and newly introduced jet ', '. These measures were so successful that by August 1944 about 80% of V-1s were being destroyed', ' (Although the Meteors were fast enough to catch the V-1s, they suffered from frequent cannon failures, and accounted for only 13.', ') In all, about 1,000 V-1s were destroyed by aircraft.', '\n', 'The intended operational altitude was originally set at 2,750\xa0m (9,000\xa0ft). However, repeated failures of a barometric fuel-pressure regulator led to it being changed in May 1944, halving the operational height, thereby bringing V-1s into range of the ', ' commonly used by Allied ', ' units.', '\n', 'The trial versions of the V-1 were air-launched. Most operational V-1s were launched from static sites on land, but from July 1944 to January 1945, the ', ' launched approximately 1,176 from modified ', ' H-22s of the ', ""'s "", ' (3rd Bomber Wing, the so-called ""Blitz Wing"") flying over the ', '. Apart from the obvious motive of permitting the bombardment campaign to continue after static ground sites on the French coast were lost, air launching gave the ', ' the opportunity to outflank the increasingly effective ground and air defences put up by the British against the missile. To minimise the associated risks (primarily radar detection), the aircrews developed a tactic called ""lo-hi-lo"": the He 111s would, upon leaving their airbases and crossing the coast, descend to an exceptionally low altitude. When the launch point was neared, the bombers would swiftly ascend, fire their V-1s, and then rapidly descend again to the previous ""wave-top"" level for the return flight. Research after the war estimated a 40% failure rate of air-launched V-1s, and the He 111s used in this role were vulnerable to night-fighter attack, as the launch lit up the area around the aircraft for several seconds. The combat potential of air-launched V-1s dwindled during 1944 at about the same rate as that of the ground-launched missiles, as the British gradually took the measure of the weapon and developed increasingly effective defence tactics.', '\n', 'Late in the war, several air-launched piloted V-1s, known as ', ', were built, but these were never used in combat. ', ' made some flights in the modified V-1 Fieseler ', ' when she was asked to find out why test pilots were unable to land it and had died as a result. She discovered, after simulated landing attempts at high altitude, where there was air space to recover, that the craft had an extremely high ', ', and the previous pilots with little high-speed experience had attempted their approaches much too slowly. Her recommendation of much higher landing speeds was then introduced in training new ', ' volunteer pilots. The ', 's were air-launched rather than fired from a catapult ramp, as erroneously portrayed in the film ', '.', '\n', 'There were plans, not put into practice, to use the ', ' jet bomber to launch V-1s either by towing them aloft or by launching them from a ""piggy back"" position (in the manner of the ', ', but in reverse) atop the aircraft. In the latter configuration, a pilot-controlled, hydraulically operated dorsal trapeze mechanism would elevate the missile on the trapeze\'s launch cradle about 8 feet (2.4\xa0m) clear of the 234\'s upper fuselage. This was necessary to avoid damaging the mother craft\'s fuselage and tail surfaces when the pulsejet ignited, as well as to ensure a ""clean"" airflow for the Argus motor\'s intake. A somewhat less ambitious project undertaken was the adaptation of the missile as a ""flying fuel tank"" ', ' for the ', ' jet fighter, which was initially test-towed behind an ', ' bomber. The pulsejet, internal systems and warhead of the missile were removed, leaving only the wings and basic fuselage, now containing a single large fuel tank. A small cylindrical module, similar in shape to a finless dart, was placed atop the vertical stabiliser at the rear of the tank, acting as a centre of gravity balance and attachment point for a variety of equipment sets. A rigid towbar with a pitch pivot at the forward end connected the flying tank to the Me 262. The operational procedure for this unusual configuration saw the tank resting on a wheeled trolley for take-off. The trolley was dropped once the combination was airborne, and explosive bolts separated the towbar from the fighter upon exhaustion of the tank\'s fuel supply. A number of test flights were conducted in 1944 with this set-up, but inflight ""porpoising"" of the tank, with the instability transferred to the fighter, meant that the system was too unreliable to be used. An identical utilisation of the V-1 flying tank for the Ar 234 bomber was also investigated, with the same conclusions reached. Some of the ""flying fuel tanks"" used in trials utilised a cumbersome fixed and spatted undercarriage arrangement, which (along with being pointless) merely increased the drag and stability problems already inherent in the design.', '\n', ""One variant of the basic Fi\xa0103 design did see operational use. The progressive loss of French launch sites as 1944 proceeded and the area of territory under German control shrank meant that soon the V-1 would lack the range to hit targets in England. Air launching was one alternative utilised, but the most obvious solution was to extend the missile's range. Thus the F-1 version developed. The weapon's fuel tank was increased in size, with a corresponding reduction in the capacity of the warhead. Additionally, the nose cones and wings of the F-1 models were made of wood, affording a considerable weight saving. With these modifications, the V-1 could be fired at London and nearby urban centres from prospective ground sites in the Netherlands. Frantic efforts were made to construct a sufficient number of F-1s in order to allow a large-scale bombardment campaign to coincide with the "", ', but numerous factors (bombing of the factories producing the missiles, shortages of steel and rail transport, the chaotic tactical situation Germany was facing at this point in the war, etc.) delayed the delivery of these long-range V-1s until February/March 1945. Beginning on 2 March 1945, slightly more than three weeks before the V-1 campaign finally ended, several hundred F-1s were launched at Britain from Dutch sites under Operation ""Zeppelin"". Frustrated by increasing Allied dominance in the air, Germany also employed V-1s to attack the RAF\'s forward airfields, such as Volkel, in the Netherlands.', '\n', 'There was also a ', '-propelled upgraded variant proposed,', ' meant to use the ', ' low-cost turbojet engine', ' with about 500\xa0kgf (1,100\xa0lbf) thrust.', '\n', 'Almost 30,000 V-1s were made; by March 1944, they were each produced in 350 hours (including 120 for the autopilot), at a cost of just 4% of a ', ',', ' which delivered a comparable payload. Approximately 10,000 were fired at England; 2,419 reached London, killing about 6,184 people and injuring 17,981.', ' The greatest density of hits was received by ', ', on the south-east fringe of London.

Initially, British experts were sceptical of the V-1 because they had considered only ', ', which could not attain the stated range of 130 miles (210 kilometres). However, they later considered other types of engine, and by the time German scientists had achieved the needed accuracy to deploy the V-1 as a weapon, British intelligence had a very accurate assessment of it.', '\n', 'The British defence against German long-range weapons was known by the ', ' with ', ' covering countermeasures to the V-1.

There was great disappointment when the truth was announced. Anti-aircraft gunners soon found that such small fast-moving targets were, in fact, very difficult to hit. The cruising altitude of the V-1, between 600 to 900\xa0m (2,000 to 3,000\xa0ft) meant that anti-aircraft guns could not traverse fast enough to hit the rocket.', '\n', 'The altitude and speed were more than the rate of traverse of the standard British ', ' mobile gun could cope with.

Fighter aircraft required excellent low altitude performance to intercept them and enough firepower to ensure that they were destroyed in the air (ideally, also from a sufficient distance, to avoid being damaged by the strong blast) rather than the V-1 crashing to earth and detonating. Most aircraft were too slow to catch a V-1 unless they had a height advantage, allowing them to gain speed by diving on their target.\n', 'When V-1 attacks began in mid-June 1944, the only aircraft with the low-altitude speed to be effective against it was the ', '.

These included using the airflow over an interceptor's wing to raise one wing of the V-1, by sliding the wingtip to within 6\xa0in (15\xa0cm) of the lower surface of the V-1's wing. If properly executed, this manoeuvre would tip the V-1's wing up, over-riding the "", ' and sending the V-1 into an out-of-control dive.

It demonstrated the ability to complete a circular course', ' and later, it completed the first 1 kilometre (0.62\xa0mi) closed-circuit flight by a rotorcraft.\n', ' and Ivan Jerome developed the ', ', with six-bladed rotors at the end of an X-shaped structure.  Two small propellers with variable pitch were used for thrust and yaw control.  The vehicle used collective pitch control. Built by the US Air Service, it made its first flight in October 1922. About 100 flights were made by the end of 1923.  The highest it ever reached was about 5\xa0m (16\xa0ft 5\xa0in). Although demonstrating feasibility, it was underpowered, unresponsive, mechanically complex and susceptible to reliability problems. Pilot workload was too high during hover to attempt lateral motion.\n', 'The ', ' was intended to be the prototype for a line of much larger civil and military helicopters. The design featured two engines driving four rotors through a system of v belts. No tail rotor was needed and control was obtained by varying the thrust between rotors.', "" Flown many times from 1956, this helicopter proved the quadrotor design and it was also the first four-rotor helicopter to demonstrate successful forward flight. Due to a lack of orders for commercial or military versions however, the project was terminated. Convertawings proposed a Model E that would have a maximum weight of 42,000\xa0lb (19\xa0t) with a payload of 10,900\xa0lb (4.9\xa0t) over 300 miles and at up to 173\xa0mph (278\xa0km/h). The Hanson Elastic Articulated (EA) bearingless rotor grew out of work done in the early 1960s at Lockheed California by Thomas F.

The need for aircraft with greater maneuverability and hovering ability has led to a rise in quadcopter research. The four-rotor design allows quadcopters to be relatively simple in design yet highly reliable and maneuverable. Research is continuing to increase the abilities of quadcopters by making advances in multi-craft communication, environment exploration, and maneuverability. If these developing qualities can be combined, quadcopters would be capable of advanced autonomous missions that are currently not possible with other vehicles.', '\n', 'Around 2005 to 2010, advances in electronics allowed the production of cheap lightweight flight controllers, ', ' (', '), ', ' and cameras. This resulted in the quadcopter configuration becoming popular for small ', '.  With their small size and maneuverability, these quadcopters can be flown indoors as well as outdoors.', '\n', 'For small drones, quadcopters are cheaper and more durable than conventional helicopters due to their mechanical simplicity.', ' Their smaller blades are also advantageous because they possess less kinetic energy, reducing their ability to cause damage. For small-scale quadcopters, this makes the vehicles safer for close interaction. It is also possible to fit quadcopters with guards that enclose the rotors, further reducing the potential for damage.', ' However, as size increases, fixed propeller quadcopters develop disadvantages relative to conventional helicopters. Increasing blade size increases their momentum. This means that changes in blade speed take longer, which negatively impacts control. Helicopters do not experience this problem as increasing the size of the rotor disk does not significantly impact the ability to control blade pitch.\n', 'Due to their ease of construction and control, quadcopters are popular as amateur ', ' projects.', '\n']"

Similar to conventional jet engines, scramjet-powered aircraft carry the fuel on board, and obtain the oxidizer by the ingestion of atmospheric oxygen (as compared to ', ', which carry both fuel and an ', ').  This requirement limits scramjets to suborbital atmospheric propulsion, where the oxygen content of the air is sufficient to maintain combustion.\n', 'The scramjet is composed of three basic components: a converging inlet, where incoming air is compressed; a combustor, where gaseous fuel is burned with atmospheric ', ' to produce heat; and a diverging nozzle, where the heated air is accelerated to produce ', '.  Unlike a typical jet engine, such as a ', ' or ', ' engine, a scramjet does not use rotating, fan-like components to compress the air; rather, the achievable speed of the aircraft moving through the atmosphere causes the air to compress within the inlet.

As they lack mechanical compressors, scramjets require the high ', ' of a hypersonic flow to compress the incoming air to operational conditions.  Thus, a scramjet-powered vehicle must be accelerated to the required velocity (usually about Mach', '4) by some other means of propulsion, such as turbojet, ', ', or rocket engines.', '  In the flight of the experimental scramjet-powered ', ', the test craft was lifted to flight altitude by a ', ' before being released and accelerated by a detachable rocket to near Mach', '4.5.', ' In May 2013, another flight achieved an increased speed of Mach', '5.1.', '\n', 'While scramjets are conceptually simple, actual implementation is limited by extreme technical challenges.  Hypersonic flight within the atmosphere generates immense drag, and temperatures found on the aircraft and within the engine can be much greater than that of the surrounding air.  Maintaining combustion in the supersonic flow presents additional challenges, as the fuel must be injected, mixed, ignited, and burned within milliseconds.  While scramjet technology has been under development since the 1950s, only very recently have scramjets successfully achieved powered flight.', '\n', 'Scramjets are designed to operate in the hypersonic flight regime, beyond the reach of turbojet engines, and, along with ramjets, fill the gap between the high efficiency of turbojets and the high speed of rocket engines.

While the flow from ', ' to low supersonic speeds can be decelerated to these conditions, doing so at supersonic speeds results in a tremendous increase in temperature and a loss in the total ', ' of the flow.  Around Mach', '3–4, turbomachinery is no longer useful, and ram-style compression becomes the preferred method.', '\n', "" utilize high-speed characteristics of air to literally 'ram' air through an inlet diffuser into the combustor.  At transonic and supersonic flight speeds, the air upstream of the inlet is not able to move out of the way quickly enough, and is compressed within the diffuser before being diffused into the combustor.  Combustion in a ramjet takes place at subsonic velocities, similar to turbojets, but the combustion products are then accelerated through a "", ' to supersonic speeds.  As they have no mechanical means of compression, ramjets cannot start from a standstill, and generally do not achieve sufficient compression until supersonic flight.  The lack of intricate turbomachinery allows ramjets to deal with the temperature rise associated with decelerating a supersonic flow to subsonic speeds, but this only goes so far: at near-hypersonic velocities, the temperature rise and inefficiencies discourage decelerating the flow to the magnitude found in ramjet engines.', '\n', 'Scramjet engines operate on the same principles as ramjets, but do not decelerate the flow to subsonic velocities.  Rather, a scramjet combustor is supersonic: the inlet decelerates the flow to a lower Mach number for combustion, after which it is accelerated to an even higher Mach number through the nozzle.  By limiting the amount of deceleration, temperatures within the engine are kept at a tolerable level, from both a material and combustive standpoint.  Even so, current scramjet technology requires the use of high-energy fuels and active cooling schemes to maintain sustained operation, often using ', ' and ', ' techniques.', '\n', 'All scramjet engines have an intake which compresses the incoming air, fuel injectors, a combustion chamber, and a divergent ', '. Sometimes engines also include a region which acts as a ', ', although the high ', ' mean that an area of focused waves may be used, rather than a discrete engine part as seen in turbine engines.  Other engines use ', ' fuel additives, such as ', ', to avoid flameout.  An isolator between the inlet and combustion chamber is often included to improve the homogeneity of the flow in the combustor and to extend the operating range of the engine.\n', 'A scramjet is reminiscent of a ', '. In a typical ramjet, the supersonic inflow of the engine is decelerated at the inlet to subsonic speeds and then reaccelerated through a nozzle to supersonic speeds to produce thrust. This deceleration, which is produced by a normal ', ',  creates a total ', ' loss which limits the upper operating point of a ramjet engine.\n', 'For a scramjet, the kinetic energy of the freestream air entering the scramjet engine is largely comparable to the energy released by the reaction of the oxygen content of the air with a fuel (e.g. hydrogen). Thus the heat released from combustion at Mach', '2.5 is around 10% of the total enthalpy of the working fluid. Depending on the fuel, the ', ' of the air and the potential combustion heat release will be equal at around Mach', '8. Thus the design of a scramjet engine is as much about minimizing drag as maximizing thrust.\n', 'This high speed makes the control of the flow within the combustion chamber more difficult. Since the flow is supersonic, no downstream influence propagates within the freestream of the combustion chamber. Throttling of the entrance to the thrust nozzle is not a usable control technique. In effect, a block of gas entering the combustion chamber must mix with fuel and have sufficient time for initiation and reaction, all the while traveling supersonically through the combustion chamber, before the burned gas is expanded through the thrust nozzle. This places stringent requirements on the pressure and temperature of the flow, and requires that the fuel injection and mixing be extremely efficient. Usable ', ' lie in the range 20 to 200 kilopascals (2.9 to 29.0\xa0psi), where\n', 'where\n', 'To keep the combustion rate of the fuel constant, the pressure and temperature in the engine must also be constant. This is problematic because the airflow control systems that would facilitate this are not physically possible in a scramjet launch vehicle due to the large speed and altitude range involved, meaning that it must travel at an altitude specific to its speed. Because air density reduces at higher altitudes, a scramjet must climb at a specific rate as it accelerates to maintain a constant air pressure at the intake. This optimal climb/descent profile is called a ""constant dynamic pressure path"". It is thought that scramjets might be operable up to an altitude of 75\xa0km.', '\n', 'Fuel injection and management is also potentially complex. One possibility would be that the fuel be pressurized to 100 bar by a turbo pump, heated by the fuselage, sent through the turbine and accelerated to higher speeds than the air by a nozzle. The air and fuel stream are crossed in a comb-like structure, which generates a large interface. Turbulence due to the higher speed of the fuel leads to additional mixing. Complex fuels like kerosene need a long engine to complete combustion.\n', 'The minimum Mach number at which a scramjet can operate is limited by the fact that the compressed flow must be hot enough to burn the fuel, and have pressure high enough that the reaction be finished before the air moves out the back of the engine. Additionally, in order to be called a scramjet, the compressed flow must still be supersonic after combustion. Here two limits must be observed: First, since when a supersonic flow is compressed it slows down, the level of compression must be low enough (or the initial speed high enough) not to slow the gas below Mach', '1. If the gas within a scramjet goes below Mach', '1 the engine will ""choke"", transitioning to subsonic flow in the combustion chamber. This effect is well known amongst experimenters on scramjets since the waves caused by choking are easily observable. Additionally, the sudden increase in pressure and temperature in the engine can lead to an acceleration of the combustion, leading to the combustion chamber exploding.\n', 'Second, the heating of the gas by combustion causes the speed of sound in the gas to increase (and the Mach number to decrease) even though the gas is still travelling at the same speed. Forcing the speed of air flow in the combustion chamber under Mach', '1 in this way is called ""thermal choking"". It is clear that a pure scramjet can operate at Mach numbers of 6–8,', ' but in the lower limit, it depends on the definition of a scramjet. There are engine designs where a ramjet transforms into a scramjet over the Mach', '3–6 range, known as dual-mode scramjets.', ' In this range however, the engine is still receiving significant thrust from subsonic combustion of the ramjet type.\n', 'The high cost of flight testing and the unavailability of ground facilities have hindered scramjet development. A large amount of the experimental work on scramjets has been undertaken in cryogenic facilities, direct-connect tests, or burners, each of which simulates one aspect of the engine operation. Further, vitiated facilities (with the ability to control air impurities', '), storage heated facilities, arc facilities and the various types of shock tunnels each have limitations which have prevented perfect simulation of scramjet operation.

Several groups, including the ', ' with the SCRAM engine between 1968 and 1974, and the ', ' program with the ', ', have claimed successful demonstrations of scramjet technology. Since these results have not been published openly, they remain unverified and a final design method of scramjet engines still does not exist.\n', ""The final application of a scramjet engine is likely to be in conjunction with engines which can operate outside the scramjet's operating range."", '\nDual-mode scramjets combine ', ' combustion with ', ' combustion for operation at lower speeds, and ', ""-based combined cycle (RBCC) engines supplement a traditional rocket's propulsion with a scramjet, allowing for additional "", "" to be added to the scramjet flow. RBCCs offer a possibility to extend a scramjet's operating range to higher speeds or lower intake dynamic pressures than would otherwise be possible.\n"", 'Unlike a rocket that quickly passes mostly vertically through the atmosphere or a turbojet or ramjet that flies at much lower speeds, a hypersonic airbreathing vehicle optimally flies a ""depressed trajectory"", staying within the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds. Because scramjets have only mediocre thrust-to-weight ratios,', ' acceleration would be limited. Therefore, time in the atmosphere at supersonic speed would be considerable, possibly 15–30 minutes. Similar to a ', ' space vehicle, heat insulation would be a formidable task, with protection required for a duration longer than that of a typical ', ', although less than the ', '.\n', 'New materials offer good insulation at high temperature, but they often ', ' themselves in the process. Therefore, studies often plan on ""active cooling"", where coolant circulating throughout the vehicle skin prevents it from disintegrating. Often the coolant is the fuel itself, in much the same way that modern rockets use their own fuel and oxidizer as coolant for their engines. All cooling systems add weight and complexity to a launch system. The cooling of scramjets in this way may result in greater efficiency, as heat is added to the fuel prior to entry into the engine, but results in increased complexity and weight which ultimately could outweigh any performance gains.\n', 'The performance of a ', ' is complex and depends greatly on its weight. Normally craft are designed to maximise range (', '), orbital radius (', ') or payload mass fraction (', ') for a given engine and fuel. This results in tradeoffs between the efficiency of the engine (takeoff fuel weight) and the complexity of the engine (takeoff dry weight), which can be expressed by the following:\n', 'Where\xa0:\n', 'A scramjet increases the mass of the motor ', ' over a rocket, and decreases the mass of the fuel ', '. It can be difficult to decide whether this will result in an increased ', ' (which would be an increased payload delivered to a destination for a constant vehicle takeoff weight). The logic behind efforts driving a scramjet is (for example) that the reduction in fuel decreases the total mass by 30%, while the increased engine weight adds 10% to the vehicle total mass. Unfortunately the uncertainty in the calculation of any mass or efficiency changes in a vehicle is so great that slightly different assumptions for engine efficiency or mass can provide equally good arguments for or against scramjet powered vehicles.\n', 'Additionally, the drag of the new configuration must be considered. The drag of the total configuration can be considered as the sum of the vehicle drag (', ') and the engine installation drag (', '). The installation drag traditionally results from the pylons and the coupled flow due to the engine jet, and is a function of the throttle setting. Thus it is often written as:\n', 'Where:\n', 'For an engine strongly integrated into the aerodynamic body, it may be more convenient to think of (', ') as the difference in drag from a known base configuration.\n', 'The overall ', ' can be represented as a value between 0 and 1 (', '), in terms of the ', ' of the engine:\n', 'Where:\n', 'Specific impulse is often used as the unit of efficiency for rockets, since in the case of the rocket, there is a direct relation between specific impulse, ', ' and exhaust velocity.

Those would also need their own separate fuel supply, structure, and systems.  Many proposals instead call for a first stage of droppable ', ', which greatly simplifies the design.\n', 'Unlike jet or rocket propulsion systems facilities which can be tested on the ground, testing scramjet designs uses extremely expensive hypersonic test chambers or expensive launch vehicles, both of which lead to high instrumentation costs.

In addition the vehicle's lower thrust does not necessarily avoid the need for the expensive, bulky, and failure-prone high performance turbopumps found in conventional liquid-fuelled rocket engines, since most scramjet designs seem to be incapable of orbital speeds in airbreathing mode, and hence extra rocket engines are needed."", '\n', 'Scramjets might be able to accelerate from approximately Mach', '5–7 to around somewhere between half of ', ' and orbital speed (X-30 research suggested that Mach', '17 might be the limit compared to an orbital speed of Mach', '25, and other studies put the upper speed limit for a pure scramjet engine between Mach', '10 and 25, depending on the assumptions made). Generally, another propulsion system (very typically, a rocket is proposed) is expected to be needed for the final acceleration into orbit.

Indeed, the unit cost of the vehicle can be expected to end up far higher, since aerospace hardware cost is about two orders of magnitude higher than liquid oxygen, fuel and tankage, and scramjet hardware seems to be much heavier than rockets for any given payload. Still, if scramjets enable reusable vehicles, this could theoretically be a cost benefit.
